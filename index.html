        <p>Random Pizza Fact - Please consider this as a description</p>
        <p>
            Historians from the William E. Macaulay Honors College discovered that the lower-income people of Naples
            would put slices of tomatoes on dough and top it with cheese to make a cheap and easy meal for their
            families. According to the researchers, tomatoes were thought to be poisonous during these days, which is
            why pizza was considered a cheaper food.
